//The useState hook is one of the most fundamental hooks in React, allowing you to 
//add state to your functional components. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how it works:
//Basic Usage First, you need to import the useState hook from React:

import Count from "./HookUseState";
import MutipleHooks from "./MultipleHooks";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Count></Count>
      <MutipleHooks></MutipleHooks>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
